"In addition to providing fields and their values in a request, you may also "
"specify options to control how your request is interpreted and how the "
"response is generated.  For GET requests, options are specified as URL "
"parameters prefixed with `opt_`.  For POST or PUT requests, options are "
"specified in the body, inside the top-level options object (a sibling of the"
" data object).  The option specified in the body overrides the `opt_` one "
