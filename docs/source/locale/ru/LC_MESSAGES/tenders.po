msgid ""
"It is often necessary to be able to syncronize central database changes to "
"other database (we'll call it \"local\").  The default sorting \"by "
"modification date\" altogether by Batching mechanism allows one to implement"
" synchronization effectively.  The synchronization process can go page by "
"page until there is no new data returned.  Then the synchronizer have to "
"pause for a while to let central database register some changes and attempt "
"fetching subsequent page.  The `next_page` guarantees to have all changes "
"from the last request to be included in new batch."
